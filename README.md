snake in ncurses to teach myself C++

## todo
* Reorganize code into classes.
* Add a game over screen, pause screen, resize options.
* There may be a bug that makes the input less fluid than other snake games I've played... need to investigate.
* Stretch goal: compile with Emscriptem to put on my website.
